## About The Project

A new way for two users to merge their musical tastes into one shared playlist made just for them, making it even easier for users to connect, discover, and bond over the music they love with one another

Here's why:
* I think spotify blend can be improved
* I want to learn more about Redux and Saga


### Built With

* [Saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/)
* [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* [Socket IO Client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io-client)
* [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)
